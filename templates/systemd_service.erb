# Please note systemd now controls multiple workers directly.
# Control of all workers jointly is done through the <%= @service_name %>.target.
#
# To restart all workers:
#   systemctl restart <%= @service_name %>.target
# To restart one particular worker:
#   systemctl restart <%= @service_name %>@1.service

# After this time SIGKILL will be sent, guaranteeing worker restart, at a cost of user jobs being terminated.
